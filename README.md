# Code-Refractor
<h1> Description </h1>
This project was intended to Code Refract which prepares you for on-the-job issues. This challenge provided a starter code which was set to correct and change HTML and CSS codes. Altering the codes based on the fictional webpage I was able to consolidate CSS codes that were repetitive to provide a clean version for other users. The search-engine-optimization was bugged and did not function properly, I was able to debug the code to construct the function to perform efficiently. 

<h2>User Story</h2>
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

<h3> Acceptance Criteria</h3>
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
