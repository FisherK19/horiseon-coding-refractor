<h1> Description </h1>
This project was intended to Code Refract which prepares you for on-the-job issues. This challenge provided a starter code which was set to correct and change HTML and CSS codes. Altering the codes based on the fictional webpage I was able to consolidate CSS codes that were repetitive to provide a clean version for other users.
